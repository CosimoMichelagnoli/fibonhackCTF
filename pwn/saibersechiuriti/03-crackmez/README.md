For this challenge you don't have the source code :)
Your goal is to find the activation key which is a string with the format:
XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX

If you want to understand how the challenge works, I suggest you to use Ghidra.
You can find it in the folder /home/security/Tools/ghidra/ and you run it by calling the command ./ghidraRun in the ghidra folder
